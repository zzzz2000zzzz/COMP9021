# Randomly fills a grid of size 7 x 7 with NE, SE, SW, NW,
# meant to represent North-East, South-East, North-West, South-West,
# respectively, and starting from the cell in the middle of the grid,
# determines, for each of the 4 corners of the grid, the preferred path amongst
# the shortest paths that reach that corner, if any. At a given cell, it is possible to move
# according to any of the 3 directions indicated by the value of the cell;
# e.g., from a cell storing NE, it is possible to move North-East, East, or North.
# At any given point, one prefers to move diagonally, then horizontally,
# and vertically as a last resort.
